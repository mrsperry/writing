This is an example.
You write out the words on the bar.
Don't worry about mistakes, they don't matter.
All you need to do is focus on the letters.
I want to make a few short stories in this format.
I think it would be pretty cool.
You can practice your typing while reading a story.
Maybe I'm crazy though.
My favorite part about this is the short sentences.
Makes it really easy to write I think.
Again, I might be crazy.
It's not done yet, but I want to know what you think.
Not like I don't always know anyway.
But hey, maybe you'll surprise me?
This is about the end of it.
Hopefully it wasn't too hard.
You get a little biased when testing, stuff becomes too easy.
Aaaaand you're done.
